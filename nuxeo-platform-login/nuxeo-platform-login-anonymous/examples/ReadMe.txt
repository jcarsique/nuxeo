Setting Up Anonymous Authentication
-----------------------------------

To enable anonymous authentication, the plugin 
nuxeo-platform-login-anonymous-XYZ.jar must be placed in your plugins/
directory, and the configuration file login-anonymous-config.xml
should be placed in your config directory.

You should edit the config file to specify the desired login name for the
Anonymous user, and its characteristics (first and last name for instance).
